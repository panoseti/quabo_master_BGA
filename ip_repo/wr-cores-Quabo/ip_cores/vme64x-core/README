VME64x Core
===========

Using the core
--------------

There is an example in the svec repository.  See svec/hdl/syn/vmecore_test
The design implements the core on a svec card, with a WB slave that implements
various features (an SRAM, a pattern area to check DMA, a simple timer to
check interrupts, a bus-error generator...).
There is a C program (in svec/software/vmecore_test) to test all these
features.

Running the testbench
---------------------

After having cloned the repository, simply do:

git submodule init
git submodule update
cd hdl/testbench/simple_tb/modelsim
hdlmake
make
sh run_all.sh

This is an automatic testbench with a yes/no status.
It runs the testbench several times with a different scenario value.
The last line should be: OK!

Tested with ModelSim SE-64 10.2a on linux.
